# GettingCleaningData

## Contents

There are two files: CodeBook.md and run_analysis.R. 

run_analysis.R transforms the Human Activity Recognition data to two tidy forms.
1)where each row corresponds to an observed activity and each column to observed mean and standard deviation over a variety of measurements, 
as well as activity and test subject, 
saved as activityaveragebysubjectactivitydata.txt
2) where each row corresponds to a pair of test subject and activity, and columns are means of the measurements in 1) over all observed cases of a particular activity and subject 
saved as activitydataclean.txt

The codebook describes the variables included.
